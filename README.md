## Goal

To build an online TCM community where normal users could find interesting and accurate information about TCM, doctor users could share their knowledge and manage their patients, and this two part users could connect with each other through tele-medicine.

### Find interesting information

### Share knowledge

- TCM experts or other content contributors could post article.

- Users could share, save or comments these articles.

- The comments come from experts should be at conspicuous position.

### Manage patients

- Make appointment.
- Every time before consultation, client need to fill a questionnaire based on the “Ten Questions of Chinese Medicine”. This could save doctors' consultation time and improve efficiency.
- Log treatment history(the symptom of patients and prescription given during every consultation).
- Click one button to purchase all the ingredients of the prescription for clients.

### Tele-medicine

....

## Business Logic

### TCM is suitable for Tele-medicine

- Unlike Western medicine relying on detection equipments in the hospital, TCM practitioners rely on their own knowledge, experience, and consultation between doctors and their clients. So TCM have a relative low dependence on the institution. Therefore, it is more convenient for doctors to practice tele-medicine.

- TCM mainly solves the problem of treating chronic diseases. Compared with treatment of acute diseases, TCM treatment takes longer period, and it is necessary to communicate and consult with doctors frequently.

- Due to the uneven distribution of TCM resources, most senior doctors are concentrated in big cities. It can reduce the time and money cost of frequent patient visits through the online platform.

- TCM practitioners are more like a "general practitioner". In addition to the patient's own follow-up consultation, the health problems of their family members can also be consulted by the same Chinese medicine practitioner, so the relationship between the doctors and patients are very strong.

### Doctors bring in their clients

- TCM is an industry that relies on reference and trust. It is difficult to establish a trust relationship between new users and physicians just through Internet.

- Senior TCM practitioners often have their own clients group. Only in the absence of a suitable platform, doctors and patients can only communicate through email or other network. Now they could just transfer these communication to our platform.

- The key point is the user experience of doctors. If doctors think this platform could help them manage their clients better and gain more business, they will be happy to try to recommend it to their clients. The patients will also follow doctor's instruction in order to communicate more conveniently with doctors.

## Target user

### People let down by Western medicine

- Now America is beset by an opioid epidemic — a national health emergency fueled by doctor prescriptions of extremely addictive painkilling narcotics.

- Western physicians will sometimes find nothing “wrong” with a patient after testing, despite persistent complaints. It was those patients, helped by nothing else, who took a chance on acupuncture in the early days of the business.

### TCM doctors who want to share knowledge and manage their patients better

- There is no yet a platform that could help TCM doctors to manage their patients and business.

## Difficulties

1. How to translate traditional medical related names and terms.

2. Low frequency, high customer cost.

## Background knowledge about TCM

### TCM in the world

TCM was included in the International Classification of Diseases for the first time during the 72nd World Health Assembly Revision. It has spread to 183 countries and regions and 67 governments in the world have recognized its legal status.

### Difference between Western medicine and TCM:

TCM is based on a holistic view of the human body and disease, which always sees the big picture and proves useful in treating chronic diseases and serving aged people in particular. Western medicine generally aims to isolate the cause of disease and treat that directly, while TCM has a holistic approach, perhaps similar to the recent Western concept of wellness.

### Potentials

- TCM has a big potential to become part of mainstream health service in the United States especially in the areas where Western medicine reaches its limitation.
- The existing Western medical therapies have difficulty in solving many medical problems, while TCM has been proven effective in treating diseases in its long history of practice in China.
- Chinese herbal products have been studied for many medical problems, including stroke, heart disease, mental disorders, and respiratory diseases (such as bronchitis and the common cold), and a national survey showed that about one in five Americans use them.
- Now, TCM products are mostly regulated as dietary supplements in the United States. And a number of TCM products have entered phase-two and even phase-three trials in the application of new drugs with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
- If FDA finally certifies T89 as a new drug, people could change their views on TCM and the possible breakthrough could fuel the development of the TCM industry.

## Acupuncture

### Recognition

- Acupuncture has been officially promoted as a potential means of reducing dependence on opioids for pain relief, and have become relatively mainstream in the U.S.
- Many of the country’s leading insurers, including Blue Cross Blue Shield and Aetna, now offer acupuncture coverage.
- Most U.S. states now offer licenses to practitioners who study for advanced degrees at the country’s numerous Eastern medicine schools.
- There are nearly 40,000 acupuncture practitioners in 47 US states.

### Effectiveness

- Results from a number of studies suggest that acupuncture may help ease types of pain that are often chronic such as low-back pain, neck pain, and osteoarthritis/knee pain.
- It also may help reduce the frequency of tension headaches and prevent migraine headaches.
- Research suggests that acupuncture can help manage certain pain conditions, but evidence about its value for other health issues is uncertain.
- Researchers are only beginning to understand whether acupuncture can be helpful for various health conditions.

### Safety

- Acupuncture is generally considered safe when performed by an experienced, well-trained practitioner using sterile needles.
- Improperly performed acupuncture can cause serious side effects.

## Herbs

Herbal therapy, despite being more significant in traditional medicine than acupuncture in China, still lags behind.

### Safety

Some uncertified Chinese herbal products have been found to be contaminated with undeclared plant or animal material; drugs; heavy metals; pesticides or compounds called sulfites, which could cause asthma or severe allergic reactions; or incorrect herbs, some of which have caused organ damage.

## Problems

- The informatization and systematic development lags behind Western medicine.
- Lack of international understanding of traditional medical terms and definitions.
- Many studies of TCM have been of poor quality, no firm conclusions can be made about their effectiveness.
- TCM products are yet to be certified by FDA as drugs and the licensing of herbalist need to be introduced separately.

## Solutions

The development of TCM shall be guided by traditional theories and more standardization work should be done.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
