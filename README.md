## Goal:

To build an online TCM community where people could find interesting facts about TCM, doctors could share their knowledge and manage their patients, and this two part could connect with each other through tele-medicine.

### Find interesting facts

1. A Search Bar

There should be a search bar at the top of main page.

Search Symptoms/herbs/recipe/doctors/locations/...

Show detail information about the search

> Say, definition, Symptoms and accompanying symptoms, Cause ...
> Show related articles
> Say suggestions how to handle these symptoms
> Show Recipe
> Different recipe for different age or sex user
> Show doctors
> Show doctors that are good at handling related symptoms or nearby

2. A List of Articles

This list will be updated daily.

User will receive an email notice everyday about the update of the reading list.

> Recommend related articles based on user interests and search

> Top popular articles

### Share knowledge

TCM experts or other content contributors could post article.

Users could share, save or comments these articles.

The comments come from experts should be at conspicuous position.

### Manage patients

....

### Tele-medicine

## Difficulties:

1. How to translate traditional medical related names and terms.

2. Low frequency, high customer cost.

## Business Logic

### Get TCM doctors first

Senior Chinese medicine practitioners often bring their own patient groups. Only in the absence of a suitable platform, doctors and patients can only communicate easily through emails or other social media. Now they could just transfer these communication to the platform of our community.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
